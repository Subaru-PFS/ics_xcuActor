External Reference Documentation
================================

The XCU Actor exposes only part of the external devices. We include or
link to the reference documentation.

The motor controller for the CCD motors is an :download:`AllMotion EZ4AXIS
<includes/EZ4AXIS_UGuide.pdf>`.

The Sunpower cryocooler :download:`command docs <AVC System Inst & Op
Manual Rev A new.pdf>` are slightly out-of-date, sadly.
