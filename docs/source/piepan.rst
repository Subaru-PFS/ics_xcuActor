New Pie-pan!
============

In order to bring up a new piepan from scratch, a few things need to
be done in order. Specifically:

 0. Requirement: the rack :doc:`MOXA must be configured <MOXA>`.

 1. The PCM must have been registered and booted with the right IP
    address.

 

TODO(c)
-------

 - Describe adding PCM to DNSMASQ
 - Describe DNSAMASQ operations
 - create correct /etc/hostname,
 - remove etc/udev/rules.d/70.persistent....
 - figure out how to regenerate new ssh host keys.
